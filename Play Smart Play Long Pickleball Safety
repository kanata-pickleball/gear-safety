**Title:** Play Smart, Play Long: The Essential Guide to Pickleball Safety
**Subtitle:** *Don’t let a preventable injury keep you out of the Kitchen.*

Pickleball is famous for being accessible and social, but "low impact" doesn't mean "no impact." As the sport grows, so do the injuries—from rolled ankles to eye injuries. The good news? Most of these are 100% preventable with a little preparation.
