# Pickleball Safety Guide: Nail Care & Injury Prevention

**Play Smart, Play Long: The Essential Guide to Pickleball Safety**

Pickleball is famous for being accessible and social, but "low impact" doesn't mean "no impact." As the sport grows, so do the injuries—from rolled ankles to eye injuries. The good news? Most of these are 100% preventable with a little preparation.

Here is a checklist for staying safe on the court so you can play your best game.

### 1. Respect the Feet (and the Nails!)
It sounds small, but foot care is critical.
* **The Shoe:** Running shoes are for moving *forward*. Pickleball shoes (or tennis court shoes) are designed for moving *side-to-side*. They have lateral support that prevents your ankle from rolling over during a quick dink.
* **The Nails:** Keep your toenails trimmed short. In pickleball, you make sudden stops that jam your foot into the front of your shoe. Long nails will bruise, turn black, and potentially fall off (a condition often called "Tennis Toe" or "Pickleball Toe").

### 1a. Why Cutting Nails is Important in Pickleball

In racquet sports like pickleball, nail care is a legitimate performance and safety issue. Here is why it matters:

Prevention of "Pickleball Toe"
This is the most common reason to trim nails. Pickleball involves sudden stops, lunges, and lateral movements. When you stop abruptly, your foot slides forward inside your shoe. If your toenails are too long, they jam against the front of the shoe.
* **The Result:** Repeated trauma causes bleeding under the nail (black toe), which is painful and can eventually cause the nail to fall off.
* **The Fix:** Keep toenails trimmed short and straight across to prevent them from hitting the toe box.

### 2. Protect Your Eyes
The pickleball ball may be plastic, but it travels fast. At the Non-Volley Zone (the Kitchen), a ball can fly at your face at 40mph.
* **The Risk:** A deflection off a paddle edge or a smashed ball can cause serious eye damage.
* **The Fix:** Wear impact-resistant eyewear. If you don't need prescription glasses, inexpensive polycarbonate safety glasses or dedicated pickleball protective eyewear are a must-have investment.

### 3. Warm Up to Play (Don’t Play to Warm Up)
Many players walk straight from the car to the court and start swinging. This is the recipe for a pulled hamstring or a torn Achilles.
* **Dynamic Stretching:** Spend 5 minutes doing movement-based stretching. High knees, butt kicks, arm circles, and gentle lunges get the blood flowing before you strike the ball.

### 4. Hydrate Like a Pro
Pickleball rallies can be long, and tournaments can last all day. Dehydration leads to muscle cramps and dizziness.
* **Tip:** Don’t wait until you are thirsty. Sip water between games and consider electrolytes if you are playing for more than an hour in the heat.

### 5. Court Awareness
* **The Surface:** Never play on a wet court. The lines on a pickleball court become like ice when wet, making slips inevitable.
* **The Space:** If a ball rolls onto your court from a neighbor, stop play immediately and yell "Ball!" Stepping on a stray ball is one of the fastest ways to break a bone.

### 6. Listen to Your Body
"Pickleball Elbow" (tendonitis) is real. It usually comes from gripping the paddle too tight or using poor form (like flicking your wrist too much). If you feel pain, rest. Playing through it usually turns a 3-day recovery into a 3-month injury.

### The Bottom Line
We all love the game because it’s fun. Taking these small safety precautions ensures you can keep having fun for years to come. Trim those nails, lace up the right shoes, and we’ll see you on the court!
