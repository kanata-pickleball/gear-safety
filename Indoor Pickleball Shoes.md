# How to Choose the Best Indoor Pickleball Shoes

### Why This Post Matters
We are seeing more **safety issues among Ottawa pickleball players during indoor games**. 

The main concern? 

**Dust and sand** on school gym floors. These surfaces are often not cleaned properly or on time, making them slippery and hazardous. This post aims to help players choose the right shoes to improve grip and reduce the risk of injuries in these conditions.


**Warning: Avoid running shoes with high heels/foam stacks as they increase the risk of ankle rolls.**

## 1. Grip and Traction
Indoor courts are smooth, and when combined with dust or sand, they become even more slippery. You need shoes with a non-marking rubber sole that grips well without sticking. Look for:
- **Herringbone or multidirectional tread patterns** for quick lateral movements.
- **Non-marking soles** to comply with gym rules and avoid damaging floors.

## 2. Lateral Support
Pickleball involves rapid side-to-side movements. Running shoes won’t cut it because they’re designed for forward motion. Instead:
- Choose shoes with **reinforced sidewalls** and **stability features**.
- A snug midfoot fit helps prevent ankle rolls during quick pivots.

## 3. Cushioning and Shock Absorption
Indoor courts are hard on joints. Good cushioning reduces fatigue and injury risk:
- Look for **foam midsoles** or **gel inserts** for impact protection.
- Avoid overly soft shoes—they can compromise stability.

---

## 4. Lightweight and Breathable
You’ll want shoes that feel light but still supportive:
- **Mesh uppers** for ventilation.
- Avoid heavy materials that slow you down during fast rallies.

---

## 5. Durability
Pickleball can be tough on shoes, especially around the toe box:
- Reinforced toe caps help withstand drag during serves and volleys.
- High-quality stitching and overlays extend lifespan.

### Indoor Basketball Shoes as an option?
Surprisingly, indoor basketball shoes can be an alternative for pickleball. Here’s why:
- **Superior lateral support:** Basketball shoes are built for quick cuts and multidirectional movement—perfect for pickleball.
- **Better grip:** Basketball shoes often have advanced traction patterns designed for hardwood courts, giving you excellent grip even on dusty surfaces.
- **Cost-effective:** In many cases, basketball shoes are cheaper than specialized pickleball shoes, making them a budget-friendly option.
- **Cushioning:** They offer great shock absorption for jumps and sprints, which translates to comfort during long pickleball sessions.

The only trade-off? Basketball shoes can be slightly heavier than dedicated court shoes, but if you prioritize grip, stability, and affordability, they’re a solid choice.
