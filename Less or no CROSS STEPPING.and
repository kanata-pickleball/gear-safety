A Tip on Footwork, Balance and Staying Safe in Pickleball

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional, just a fellow pickleball enthusiast! I've spent effort working on my own balance and footwork, and I hope you don’t mind I am sharing some tips after watching a YouTube video.

One of the biggest game-changers for me was learning to avoid the cross-step—that move where you cross one foot over the other to reach for a ball. It might feel natural at first, but it can lead to a few problems on the court:
 * ⚠️ It creates imbalance: For that brief moment when your feet are crossed, all your weight is on one leg. This makes you unstable right when you need a solid base to hit a controlled shot.
 * ⚠️ It slows your recovery: Uncrossing your feet takes extra time, which can make it tough to get back to a neutral "ready" position for your opponent's next shot.
 * ⚠️ It’s risky during fast exchanges: In a quick volley rally at the net, being even slightly off-balance from a cross-step can cause you to pop the ball up or miss it entirely. It's a recipe for an unforced error and can even lead to a fall.
✅ The Better, Safer Alternative:
Instead, try to use shuffle steps (quick side steps). By keeping your feet apart and your body low, you maintain a wide, stable base. This keeps you balanced, centered, and ready to react instantly.
For a fantastic and detailed guide on this topic, I highly recommend watching this video from 50+ Coach Tony Roig. He’s a senior pro who breaks down safe and efficient movement, especially for players over 50. He covers why to avoid the cross-step [03:00] and teaches safer alternatives like the "open the door" technique to cover lobs [07:37]. It’s a great resource for improving your court coverage while protecting yourself from injury.
