# 🛡️ Pickleball Gear and Safety   

**A community-driven repository for equipment safety & tips.**

## 📖 About

This repository serves as the central knowledge base for safety and pickleball gear. Its goal is to share information to prevent injury and maintain equipment.

## ⚠️ Key Safety Guidelines

### 1\. Eye Protection

  * **Recommendation:** Protective eyewear is highly encouraged for all players, especially during net play.
  * **Why:** To protect against stray balls, paddle collisions, and court debris.

### 2\. Footwear
  * **Warning:** Avoid running shoes with high heels/foam stacks as they increase the risk of ankle rolls.

### 3\. Paddle Maintenance
  * **Surface:** Ensure the paddle surface is not degraded (delaminated), which can deaden shots and cause arm strain.

### 4\. Cold Weather Gear (Kanata Context)

  * **Balls:** Outdoor balls can crack easily in temperatures below 5°C. Use softer indoor balls or cold-weather specific outdoor balls if playing late season.
